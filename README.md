Stages:
1. Dataset Generation is a project for generating and annotating a dataset for training models.
2. Text Detection is a project for segmenting text on an image. (<- current stage)
3. Text Recognition is a project for recognizing text on images.
4. Tune and union - the final stage. Optimization of models, improvement of accuracy, comparison with existing models.
